              <p className="mt-3 text-base text-gray-600">
                Face shape detector only uses the uploaded photos to analyze
                them and never store your images permanently. Protecting your
                privacy has always been our first concern. Once the artificial
                intelligence is done processing the image, it’s not stored in
                our cloud storage.

                No artificial intelligence can be 100% accurate in every

                and algorithms. After extracting the information from your
                photo, this face shape detector filters it cross-checks the
                information with inserted data, and delivers an accurate result.

                Your face shape might change depending on various factors. In
                most cases, face shapes don’t change as it depends on the facial
                bones. But, losing or gaining weight, stress, disease, or other
                extensive exercise of the face might have some effect on face
                shape.

                Currently, our face shape detector can only analyze individual
                faces. So, you must upload a single front-facing image and avoid
                using group pictures. The artificial intelligence to detect
                multiple face shapes once is a work in progress and soon our AI
                face shape detector will be updated.
